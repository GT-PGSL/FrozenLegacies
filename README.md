# FrozenLegacies: Investigating Four Decades of Change Beneath Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf

**Frozen Legacies** brings together newly digitized radar film from historic 1970s Antarctic flights and today's advanced airborne surveys to reveal how the Ross Ice Shelf has changed over nearly 50 years. By peering beneath the ice with radar, our team is uncovering the story of Antarctica's largest ice shelf‚Äîhelping scientists, educators, and the public understand the frozen frontier's past, present, and future.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This collaborative initiative between **Georgia Tech**, **Stanford University**, and **Colorado School of Mines** addresses critical knowledge gaps in ice shelf evolution by providing the first direct measurements of ice shelf changes over nearly half a century.

### Key Achievements

- üéØ **First direct measurements** of basal melt rates beneath the Ross Ice Shelf
- üìº **Digitizing and analyzing** 1970s radar data for new discoveries  
- üéì **Engaging students and educators** in real polar research
- ü§ù **Multi-institutional collaboration** bringing together leading researchers

## üìä Executive Summary

**Frozen Legacies** represents an unprecedented investigation of Antarctica's Ross Ice Shelf, combining newly digitized 1970s radar film with modern airborne surveys to provide the first direct measurements of ice shelf changes over nearly half a century.

By processing, calibrating, and analyzing over **400,000 line-kilometers** of historical radar data, we directly compare subsurface conditions with modern observations from:
- NASA Operation IceBridge
- NSF CReSIS
- ROSETTA-Ice

### Why This Matters

The Ross Ice Shelf buttresses glaciers that could raise global sea levels by **11.6 meters** if lost. Understanding its long-term behavior is crucial for:
- Climate projections and modeling
- Coastal planning worldwide
- Antarctic ice sheet stability assessments
